# Japanese Holidayüéâ

We store Japanese holidays obtained from Google Calendar by year in JSON and CSV formats.

## How to useü§î
This project is hosted on GitHub Pages.<br>
[GitHub Pages](https://ennacx.github.io/jp-holiday/)

### Basic
To get basic information about national holidays and festival holidays for the past three years, including last year, this year, and next year, access ```date.json``` or ```date.csv```.<br>
(Each version is separated into a directory. ```v1```, ```v2```...)

Ex. https://ennacx.github.io/jp-holiday/v1/date.json

### Separate national-holidays, festival-holidays
We also provide a list filtered by national holidays only, and a list filtered by festival holidays only.

National holidays only: https://ennacx.github.io/jp-holiday/v1/shu/date.json<br>
Festival holidays only: https://ennacx.github.io/jp-holiday/v1/sai/date.json

### Divide year
To get a list divided by year, specify the directory for the year after the version.<br>
(Data is available for the preceding 5 years.)

Ex.<br>
2024's Japanese holidays: https://ennacx.github.io/jp-holiday/v1/2024/date.json<br>
2024's national holidays only: https://ennacx.github.io/jp-holiday/v1/2024/shu/date.json<br>
2024's festival holidays only: https://ennacx.github.io/jp-holiday/v1/2024/sai/date.json

### Date format and Timestamp format
The contents of file ```date.json``` are objects whose keys are in the format ```'YYYY-MM-DD'``` (```string```) and whose values are the names of holidays
(In the case of CSV, the first column contains the dates and the second column contains the names of holidays.).<br>
But we have also prepared a file whose keys are in the format of a timestamp (```integer```).
When using this, please change ```date.json``` to ```ts.json```.
